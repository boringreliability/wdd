# WDD — Session Context

You are working on **wdd**, a project managed with Ward-Driven Development (WDD).
All project state lives in the `.wdd/` directory as markdown files with YAML frontmatter.

## Ward Lifecycle — Checkpoint Discipline

Every Ward follows this exact sequence. **You MUST STOP at each checkpoint.**

```
planned → red (write tests)
    ⏸️ STOP — Present tests to human. Wait for "approved".
    NEVER proceed without explicit human approval.

red → approved → gold (implement until tests pass)
    ⏸️ STOP — Present implementation to human. Wait for "approved"/"godkendt".
    NEVER proceed without explicit human approval.

gold → complete (via wdd complete)
```

**Rules:**
- NEVER skip from Red to Gold without human approving the tests
- NEVER skip from Gold to Complete without human approving the implementation
- NEVER start the next Ward before the current one is approved as complete
- If tests fail during Gold, fix them — do NOT change the test expectations

## CLI Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `wdd session` | Get full project context (start here) |
| `wdd status` | Show progress dashboard |
| `wdd ward create "Name" --epic <slug>` | Create a new Ward |
| `wdd ward status <id> <status>` | Update Ward status |
| `wdd complete <id>` | Complete a Ward (snapshot + progress) |
| `wdd validate` | Check structural integrity |
| `wdd progress` | Regenerate PROGRESS.md |
| `wdd ward reopen <id> --reason "text"` | Reopen a completed Ward |
| `wdd epic create "Name" --slug <slug>` | Create a new Epic |
| `wdd search <query> [--tag <tag>]` | Search project memory |
| `wdd bootstrap claude\|cursor` | Install AI adapter |
| `wdd init --name "project"` | Initialize WDD in a new project |

## After Completing a Ward

1. Run `wdd complete <id>` — it will snapshot CONTEXT.md and regenerate PROGRESS.md
2. Follow the commit reminder in the output
3. Update CONTEXT.md: "Current State" and "What Comes Next"
4. Run `wdd validate` to check CONTEXT.md size limits

## File Protocol

- `.wdd/wards/ward-NNN.md` — Ward specs with YAML frontmatter (source of truth for status)
- `.wdd/CONTEXT.md` — Living document, updated after each Ward (max 200 lines)
- `.wdd/PROJECT.md` — Project identity and principles (rarely changes)
- `.wdd/PROGRESS.md` — Auto-generated, never hand-edit
- `.wdd/memory/` — Decisions, learnings, snapshots


## What To Do

1. Run `wdd session` and read the full output carefully
2. Run `wdd validate` to check project health
3. Summarize for the user:
   - Current state of the project
   - Which Ward is active and its status
   - Any blockers or warnings from validate
4. Ask the user what they want to work on
